Cut out ESP32Base from 1/8 inch or 0.1 inch 5056 Aluminum or 1/8 inch Lexan.
Fold the motor support tabs to 90 degrees.
Use 2.5mm screws to attach continuous rotation micro servos. Washers and nuts may, or may not be needed. My screws threaded into the servos so nuts were not required.
Solder 15 pin 2.54 Stackable Long leg Headers to ESP32 Dev Modules.
